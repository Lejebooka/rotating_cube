# Rotating Cube

This project is a simple 3D simulation of a rotating cube implemented in Rust. The cube is displayed in text mode using various symbols for each face, adding visual diversity and interest.

## Key Features:
- **Cube Rotation**: The cube rotates around three axes (X, Y, and Z), creating a 3D effect.
- **Use of Symbols**: Each face of the cube is displayed using unique symbols, making it easy to differentiate between them.
- **Projection**: A projection of 3D coordinates onto a 2D screen is implemented using Z-buffering for accurate depth representation.

## Technologies:
- **Rust**: Used to ensure performance and memory safety.
- **Text Output**: The program outputs results to the terminal, allowing it to run in any environment that supports a text interface.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Rust installed.
2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lejebooka/rotating_cube.git
cd rotating_cube
cargo run
```
